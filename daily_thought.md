PCIe is a multi-layer protocol for asynchronously (no shared clock) transmitting data between the host system and a device. Since a PCIe bus has its own internal clock, it is abstracted from the timing and other hardware aspects of the host system. These two facts enable a high degree of interopability between PCIe devices and host systems.

The MI250 has 362 TFLOPs of half-precision performance with a peak HBM bandwidth of 3.2 TB/s. A TFLOP is one trillion floating point operations. The GPU can pull in, at most, (3.2 * 10^12 bytes) / 2 = 1.6 trillion FP16 values per second, but can perform 362 trillion operations per second.
