# About Me

Hi, my name is Turner Jabbour and I've been a programmer for about 6 years. My professional experience is exclusively in Node and React. Recently, I've become very interested in ROCm and the success of AMD overall.

This repo is me learning in public about much lower-level concepts than I am used to. For now, I am exploring different "beginner" kernels and including a write up where I attempt to describe the purpose of the kernel and the things I learned while writing it.
