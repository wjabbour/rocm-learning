Hi, my name is Turner Jabbour and I've been a programmer for about 6 years. My professional experience is
exclusively in web development and backend development. Recently, I've become very interested in ROCm and the success 
of AMD overall. This repo is me learning in public about much lower-level concepts than I am used to.
